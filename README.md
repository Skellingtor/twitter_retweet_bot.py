# twitter_retweet_bot.py
I host a podcast and was having issues keeping up with consistently tweeting so I created a bot that retweets based on list of usernames
so that our twitter account has consistent content. This has helped us gain more followers as we are getting more engagement and consistently
delivering value to our followers. 

I stick to a list of 6 people retweeted hourly so as not to overwhelm, the only thing missing is however you want
to host the bot itself. If you want to use this bot but don't have a way to host, let me know and I can walk you through how I set up mine.  

Hope this is helpful too you and let me know if you have suggestions or questions!
